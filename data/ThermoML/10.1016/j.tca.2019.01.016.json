All tested alloys were prepared from high purity metals (Ag and Li) by melting in a glove-box filled with high purity argon, with a very low concentration of impurities. The high-temperature X-ray diffraction investigations were conducted to confirm the structure of the prepared alloys. The thermal expansion measurements of the Agrich alloys were carried out by an optical, horizontal dilatometer at the temperature range from 298 to 665 K. Moreover, the electrical conductivity of investigated Ag-rich alloys was measured at room temperature. The results of X-ray diffraction phase analysis, thermal expansion and electrical conductivity measurements, obtained in these studies, may undermine the reliability of the present phase diagram of Ag-Li, which makes it necessary to verify the existing phase equilibria. Further thermodynamic and physicochemical studies of Ag-Li system are crucial to get complete data for the optimization of the thermodynamic properties and calculation of the reliable phase diagram of the Ag-Li system."},"Compound":[{"sStandardInChI":"InChI=1S/Ag","RegNum":{"nOrgNum":1,"tml_elements":["nOrgNum"]},"sStandardInChIKey":"BQCADISMDOOEFD-UHFFFAOYSA-N","tml_elements":["RegNum","sStandardInChI","sStandardInChIKey","sCommonName","sFormulaMolec","Sample"],"sCommonName":["silver","argentum","silver element"],"Sample":[{"eSource":"Commercial source","nSampleNm":1,"purity":[{"eAnalMeth":["Stated by supplier"],"nPurityMass":99.9,"nPurityMassDigits":3,"tml_elements":["nStep","nPurityMass","nPurityMassDigits","eAnalMeth"],"nStep":1}],"tml_elements":["nSampleNm","eSource","purity"]}],"sFormulaMolec":"Ag"}],"tml_elements":["Version","Citation","Compound","PureOrMixtureData"],"PureOrMixtureData":[{"nPureOrMixtureDataNumber":1,"dateDateAdded":"2/25/2020","sCompiler":"AB","NumValues":[{"tml_elements":["VariableValue","PropertyValue"],"PropertyValue":[{"tml_elements":["nPropNumber","nPropValue","nPropDigits","CombinedUncertainty"],"nPropNumber":1,"nPropDigits":4,"CombinedUncertainty":{"tml_elements":["nCombUncertAssessNum","nCombExpandUncertValue"],"nCombExpandUncertValue":610000,"nCombUncertAssessNum":1},"nPropValue":61070000}],"VariableValue":[{"nVarValue":298,"nVarNumber":1,"nVarDigits":3,"tml_elements":["nVarNumber","nVarValue","nVarDigits"]},{"nVarNumber":2,"tml_elements":["nVarNumber","nVarValue","nVarDigits"],"nVarDigits":6,"nVarValue":101.325}]}],"eExpPurpose":"Principal objective of the work","Property":[{"nPropNumber":1,"PropPhaseID":{"tml_elements":["ePropPhase"],"ePropPhase":"Crystal"},"tml_elements":["nPropNumber","Property-MethodID","PropPhaseID","ePresentation","CombinedUncertainty"],"ePresentation":"Direct value, X","Property-MethodID":{"PropertyGroup":{"TransportProp":{"tml_elements":["ePropName","sMethodName"],"ePropName":"Electrical conductivity, S/m","sMethodName":"SIGMATEST 2.069 (Foerster) testing instrument - complex impedance measurements"},"tml_elements":["TransportProp"]},"tml_elements":["PropertyGroup"]},"CombinedUncertainty":{"nCombUncertAssessNum":1,"sCombUncertEvaluator":"Data file compiler","tml_elements":["nCombUncertAssessNum","sCombUncertEvaluator","eCombUncertEvalMethod","nCombUncertLevOfConfid"],"eCombUncertEvalMethod":"Propagation of evaluated standard uncertainties","nCombUncertLevOfConfid":95}}],"sContributor":"TRC","Variable":[{"nVarNumber":1,"VarPhaseID":{"eVarPhase":"Crystal","tml_elements":["eVarPhase"]},"tml_elements":["nVarNumber","VariableID","VarPhaseID"],"VariableID":{"VariableType":{"tml_elements":["eTemperature"],"eTemperature":"Temperature, K"},"tml_elements":["VariableType"]}},{"tml_elements":["nVarNumber","VariableID","VarPhaseID"],"VarPhaseID":{"eVarPhase":"Crystal","tml_elements":["eVarPhase"]},"nVarNumber":2,"VariableID":{"tml_elements":["VariableType"],"VariableType":{"ePressure":"Pressure, kPa","tml_elements":["ePressure"]}}}],"tml_elements":["nPureOrMixtureDataNumber","Component","eExpPurpose","sCompiler","sContributor","dateDateAdded","Property","PhaseID","Variable","NumValues"],"PhaseID":[{"ePhase":"Crystal","tml_elements":["ePhase"]}],"Component":[{"nSampleNm":1,"RegNum":{"tml_elements":["nOrgNum"],"nOrgNum":1},"tml_elements":["RegNum","nSampleNm"]}]}]}
