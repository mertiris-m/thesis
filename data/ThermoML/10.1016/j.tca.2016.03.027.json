Acta","sAbstract":"A series of tetra-functional fluorene-based benzoxazines containing both flexible linear aliphatic chainand rigid aromatic structure in their backbones were synthesized using mixed amines such as anilineand n-octylamine, 2,7-dihydroxy-9,9-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene (THPF) and paraformaldehyde asraw materials via Mannich reaction. The prepared benzoxazine monomers were identified by fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). In addition, thecuring behavior, curing kinetics and rheological properties of these monomers as well as the thermaland mechanical properties of their cured resins were studied using a rheometer, differential scanningcalorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and dynamic thermomechanical analyzer (DMA).The newly developed benzoxazines show good processibility, excellent thermal stability and high glasstransition temperature (Tg) values ranging from 291 to 307.C. By varying the proportion of n-octylamineto aniline, the properties of these resins are tuned.","TRCRefID":{"nAuthorn":"0","tml_elements":["yrYrPub","sAuthor1","sAuthor2","nAuthorn"],"sAuthor1":"fen","sAuthor2":"wan","yrYrPub":"2016"},"sDOI":"10.1016/j.tca.2016.03.027","sTitle":"Tunable properties of novel tetra-functional fluorene-based benzoxazines from mixed amines: Synthesis, characterization andcuring kinetics","tml_elements":["TRCRefID","eType","eSourceType","sAuthor","sPubName","yrPubYr","dateCit","sTitle","sAbstract","sKeyword","sDOI","sVol","sPage"],"sAuthor":["Feng, T.[Tiantian]","Wang, J.[Jun]","Pan, L.[Lan]","Derradji, M.[Mehdi]","Ramdani, N.[Noureddine]","Liu, W.[Wenbin]","Zhou, H.[Haoran]"],"sKeyword":["Tetra-functional","Fluorene-based benzoxazines","Curing kinetics","Tunable properties"],"eSourceType":"Original"},"THERMOML_MD5_CHECKSUM":"0451f06b4af24b5779c6736b4e48043b","Compound":[{"sCommonName":["3,8-diphenyl-12,12-bis(3-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazin-6-yl)-3,4,7,8,9,12-hexahydro-2H-fluoreno[3,2-e:6,7-e']bis([1,3]oxazine)"],"Sample":[{"nSampleNm":1,"eSource":"Synthesized by the authors","purity":[],"tml_elements":["nSampleNm","eSource","purity"]}],"tml_elements":["RegNum","sStandardInChI","sStandardInChIKey","sCommonName","sFormulaMolec","Sample"],"sFormulaMolec":"C57H46N4O4","RegNum":{"nOrgNum":1,"tml_elements":["nOrgNum"]},"sStandardInChI":"InChI=1S/C57H46N4O4/c1-5-13-45(14-6-1)58-31-39-25-43(21-23-53(39)62-35-58)57(44-22-24-54-40(26-44)32-59(36-63-54)46-15-7-2-8-16-46)51-29-55-41(33-60(37-64-55)47-17-9-3-10-18-47)27-49(51)50-28-42-34-61(48-19-11-4-12-20-48)38-65-56(42)30-52(50)57/h1-30H,31-38H2","sStandardInChIKey":"RYQUQZVAVLRIGR-UHFFFAOYSA-N"}],"tml_elements":["Version","Citation","Compound","PureOrMixtureData"],"PureOrMixtureData":[{"PhaseID":[{"tml_elements":["ePhase"],"ePhase":"Crystal"},{"ePhase":"Liquid","tml_elements":["ePhase"]},{"ePhase":"Air at 1 atmosphere","tml_elements":["ePhase"]}],"tml_elements":["nPureOrMixtureDataNumber","Component","eExpPurpose","sCompiler","sContributor","dateDateAdded","Property","PhaseID","NumValues"],"Component":[{"RegNum":{"tml_elements":["nOrgNum"],"nOrgNum":1},"nSampleNm":1,"tml_elements":["RegNum","nSampleNm"]}],"sContributor":"TRC","Property":[{"CombinedUncertainty":{"nCombUncertLevOfConfid":95,"eCombUncertEvalMethod":"Propagation of evaluated standard uncertainties","tml_elements":["nCombUncertAssessNum","sCombUncertEvaluator","eCombUncertEvalMethod","nCombUncertLevOfConfid"],"sCombUncertEvaluator":"Data file compiler","nCombUncertAssessNum":1},"nPropNumber":1,"Property-MethodID":{"tml_elements":["PropertyGroup"],"PropertyGroup":{"tml_elements":["PhaseTransition"],"PhaseTransition":{"sMethodName":"DTA","ePropName":"Normal melting temperature, K","tml_elements":["ePropName","sMethodName"]}}},"PropPhaseID":{"tml_elements":["ePropPhase"],"ePropPhase":"Crystal"},"tml_elements":["nPropNumber","Property-MethodID","PropPhaseID","ePresentation","CombinedUncertainty"],"ePresentation":"Direct value, X"}],"eExpPurpose":"Principal objective of the work","sCompiler":"AB","dateDateAdded":"8/29/2016","nPureOrMixtureDataNumber":1,"NumValues":[{"VariableValue":[],"tml_elements":["PropertyValue"],"PropertyValue":[{"CombinedUncertainty":{"nCombUncertAssessNum":1,"tml_elements":["nCombUncertAssessNum","nCombExpandUncertValue"],"nCombExpandUncertValue":1},"nPropValue":433.15,"tml_elements":["nPropNumber","nPropValue","nPropDigits","CombinedUncertainty"],"nPropDigits":2,"nPropNumber":1}]}]}]}
