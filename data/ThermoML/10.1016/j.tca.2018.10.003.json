Two methods were established to obtain reaction thermodynamic parameters, model-free method(Friedman method) and model-based method. By Friedman method, the activation energy of BPO with NaOH solution changed greatly, which demonstrated that the reaction was a multistep reaction. By model-based method, BPO with NaOH solution can be described as A B C, where the first step A B is an autocatalytic reaction, the second step B C is a n-order reaction. Finally, the self-accelerating decomposition temperature(SADT) was predicted and the result indicated that SADT of BPO with NaOH solution is -1 , which is much lower than BPO.","sTitle":"Thermal behavior of benzoyl peroxide mixed with NaOH solution","sDOI":"10.1016/j.tca.2018.10.003"},"Compound":[{"sStandardInChIKey":"OMPJBNCRMGITSC-UHFFFAOYSA-N","RegNum":{"tml_elements":["nOrgNum"],"nOrgNum":1},"sStandardInChI":"InChI=1S/C14H10O4/c15-13(11-7-3-1-4-8-11)17-18-14(16)12-9-5-2-6-10-12/h1-10H","Sample":[{"eSource":"Commercial source","nSampleNm":1,"purity":[{"nStep":1,"tml_elements":["nStep","nUnknownPerCent","nUnknownPerCentDigits","eAnalMeth"],"eAnalMeth":["Stated by supplier"],"nUnknownPerCentDigits":2,"nUnknownPerCent":98}],"tml_elements":["nSampleNm","eSource","purity"]}],"sCommonName":["benzoyl peroxide","acetoxyl","benoxyl","benzoperoxide","benzoyl superoxide","dibenzoyl peroxide"],"tml_elements":["RegNum","sStandardInChI","sStandardInChIKey","sCommonName","sFormulaMolec","Sample"],"sFormulaMolec":"C14H10O4"}],"tml_elements":["Version","Citation","Compound","PureOrMixtureData"],"PureOrMixtureData":[{"NumValues":[{"VariableValue":[],"PropertyValue":[{"nPropNumber":1,"nPropDigits":4,"tml_elements":["nPropNumber","nPropValue","nPropDigits","CombinedUncertainty"],"CombinedUncertainty":{"nCombUncertAssessNum":1,"nCombExpandUncertValue":4.1,"tml_elements":["nCombUncertAssessNum","nCombExpandUncertValue"]},"nPropValue":377.75}],"tml_elements":["PropertyValue"]}],"nPureOrMixtureDataNumber":1,"dateDateAdded":"6/5/2019","sCompiler":"AB","eExpPurpose":"Principal objective of the work","Property":[{"Property-MethodID":{"PropertyGroup":{"tml_elements":["PhaseTransition"],"PhaseTransition":{"tml_elements":["ePropName","sMethodName"],"sMethodName":"DSC","ePropName":"Triple point temperature, K"}},"tml_elements":["PropertyGroup"]},"CombinedUncertainty":{"sCombUncertEvaluator":"Data file compiler","nCombUncertAssessNum":1,"nCombUncertLevOfConfid":95,"eCombUncertEvalMethod":"Propagation of evaluated standard uncertainties","tml_elements":["nCombUncertAssessNum","sCombUncertEvaluator","eCombUncertEvalMethod","nCombUncertLevOfConfid"]},"PropPhaseID":{"tml_elements":["ePropPhase"],"ePropPhase":"Crystal"},"nPropNumber":1,"ePresentation":"Direct value, X","tml_elements":["nPropNumber","Property-MethodID","PropPhaseID","ePresentation","CombinedUncertainty"]}],"sContributor":"TRC","Component":[{"tml_elements":["RegNum","nSampleNm"],"RegNum":{"nOrgNum":1,"tml_elements":["nOrgNum"]},"nSampleNm":1}],"tml_elements":["nPureOrMixtureDataNumber","Component","eExpPurpose","sCompiler","sContributor","dateDateAdded","Property","PhaseID","NumValues"],"PhaseID":[{"ePhase":"Crystal","tml_elements":["ePhase"]},{"ePhase":"Liquid","tml_elements":["ePhase"]},{"ePhase":"Air at 1 atmosphere","tml_elements":["ePhase"]}]}],"Version":{"tml_elements":["nVersionMajor","nVersionMinor"],"nVersionMajor":2,"nVersionMinor":0}}
