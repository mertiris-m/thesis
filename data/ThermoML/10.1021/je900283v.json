Molecular and system properties were determined from titration, partition, and solubility studies using UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, while solid state characterization of the 10-HC was carried out with X-ray, DSC, and TGA. The enthalpies of solution of the unionized and ionized forms of 10-HC, as deduced from isothermal and iso-pH equilibrium solubility measurements, were 45.4 kJ*mol-1 and 22.7 kJ*mol-1, respectively. The pKa of 10-HC was determined to be 1.42 at 25 deg C, while the basicity of the quinoline group of 10-HC was shown to decrease with increasing temperature due to a positive enthalpy of deprotonation of 23.6 kJ*mol-1. The intrinsic partition coefficient of 10-HC was determined to be 6.49, which is significantly smaller than that of the parent camptothecin. Evidently, the hydroxyl substitution on the A ring of camptothecin renders the molecule considerably more polar, though still hydrophobic and sparingly soluble in aqueous media. Dissolution studies supported by X-ray and thermal analysis revealed polymorphism and serious metastability of the 10-HC anhydrous form in aqueous solutions. The aqueous solubility of 10-HC-lactone monohydrate was found to be pH and temperature dependent with an estimated intrinsic solubility of (1.81 +- 0.2) ?M. Contrary to the low intrinsic solubility, the solubility of 10-HC in extremely acidic media increased by more than 3 orders of magnitude. This feature can be used to facilitate fabrication of highly efficient drug delivery systems for 10-HC systemic administration.","TRCRefID":{"yrYrPub":"2010","tml_elements":["yrYrPub","sAuthor1","sAuthor2","nAuthorn"],"nAuthorn":"0","sAuthor2":"sav","sAuthor1":"kun"},"sTitle":"Thermodynamic Studies of 10-hydroxy-Camptothecin in Aqueous Solutions","sDOI":"10.1021/je900283v"},"Compound":[{"Sample":[{"nSampleNm":1,"eSource":"Commercial source","purity":[{"tml_elements":["nStep","nPurityMass","nPurityMassDigits","eAnalMeth"],"nPurityMassDigits":2,"nStep":1,"nPurityMass":98,"eAnalMeth":["Stated by supplier"]}],"tml_elements":["nSampleNm","eSource","purity"]}],"sCommonName":["20-(S)-4-ethyl-4,9-dihydroxy-1H-pyrano(3',4':6,7)indolizino(1,2-b)quinoline-3,14 (4H, 12H)-dione"],"tml_elements":["RegNum","sStandardInChI","sStandardInChIKey","sCommonName","sFormulaMolec","Sample"],"sFormulaMolec":"C20H16N2O5","RegNum":{"nOrgNum":1,"tml_elements":["nOrgNum"]},"sStandardInChI":"InChI=1S/C20H16N2O5/c1-2-20(26)14-7-16-17-11(5-10-6-12(23)3-4-15(10)21-17)8-22(16)18(24)13(14)9-27-19(20)25/h3-7,23,26H,2,8-9H2,1H3/t20-/m0/s1","sStandardInChIKey":"HAWSQZCWOQZXHI-FQEVSTJZSA-N"}],"Version":{"nVersionMinor":0,"nVersionMajor":2,"tml_elements":["nVersionMajor","nVersionMinor"]}}
